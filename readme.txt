This plugin makes it easy for a developer to document the plugins, custom post types, etc. on a site, and creates a PDF to give to the client.

== Description ==
Ever start working on a site and wonder to yourself "Why is that plugin installed, what does it do?"  Yeah, me too.  This plugin enumerates the plugins and custom post types on a site, with a description blank for each.  You can then output the descriptions to a PDF to give to your clients so that they know what's installed and why.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-documenter` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

== Changelog ==
1.0 - Initial release.
2.0 - Major changes behind the scenes.
